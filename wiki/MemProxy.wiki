A proxy application that caches data in memcached.

= Introduction =

MemProxy is a simple (bet very powerful) PHP script that proxies web requests
and stores the contents in memcached.  By being a full proxy, it allows the
proxy servers to avoid heavy application level code.  This makes it very fast
and efficient.  It also allows for a very simple set up on dedicated proxy
servers.  Configurations for Apache and nginx are included in this
documentation.

= Requirements =

    * PHP 5.2 with the PECL/memcache extension.
    * A web server that has rewrite abilities. Apache and Nginx examples provided.
    * memcached
