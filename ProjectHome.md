MemProxy is a simple (but very powerful) PHP script that proxies web requests and stores the contents in memcached.  By being a full proxy, it allows the proxy servers to avoid heavy application level code.  This makes it very fast and efficient.  It also allows for a very simple set up on dedicated proxy
servers.
